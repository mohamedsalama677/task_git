# My Project

## Annotated Version vs Lightweight Version

- **Annotated Version**: Includes a message and metadata (e.g., author, date). Useful for release notes.
- **Lightweight Version**: A simple pointer to a commit. Useful for quick references.

## Rebase vs Merge

- **Rebase**: Reapplies commits on top of another base tip. Useful for maintaining a linear project history.
- **Merge**: Combines multiple sequences of commits. Useful for integrating changes from different branches.

## Use Cases
- **Rebase**: When you want to clean up a feature branch before merging.
- **Merge**: When you want to preserve the complete history of changes.
